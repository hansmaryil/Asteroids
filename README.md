Asteroids
=========

This game is a rendition of the popular game of Asteroids (1979). 
Asteroids is a relatively simple game by today's standards, but was still
immensely popular during its time.  Searching for 'asteroids arcade' yields links
to multiple versions of Asteroids that are available on the web (including an 
updated version by Atari, the original creator of Asteroids).

This is a game built using CodeSkulptor.org a development environment built by Scott Rixner.
